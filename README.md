# Gem Allowlist

This is a prototype example of creating a repository allowlist for gems. If any gem that is not on the allowlist is added in a PR, CI for that PR would fail, warning you about the disallowed gems.

This is a PROTOTYPE, only meant to serve as an example and is far from feature complete. This was created as part of a talk for RailsConf 2022 by [@aellispiece](https://github.com/aellispierce) and [@bettymakes](https://github.com/bettymakes).
